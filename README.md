# Food Web Website

This repository is the in-progress migration of the original Food Web website from vanilla JavaScript to React.js.

Food Web is an initiative to connect communities with their local food systems through a platform designed to engage users and increase access to fresh, local produce. The website features an interactive map of community gardens, local farms, farmers markets, food banks, and compost collection sites, along with search and filtering, user authentication, and site information management features.

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript
- Supabase (database & authentication)
- Netlify (deployment)
