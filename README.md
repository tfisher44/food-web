# Food Web Website

Food Web is an initiative to connect communities with their local food systems, increase access to locally grown food, inspire community engagement, and facilitate visibility and collaboration among growers, distributors, volunteers and community members.

This repository contains the ongoing migration of the original Food Web website from vanilla JavaScript to React.js.

## Features
- Interactive map of community gardens, local farms, farmers markets, food banks, and compost collection sites (currently the sites are based in Arizona but we plan to expand to other states in the future)
- Site profiles including site name, address, website, contact information, description, hours, and produce
- Search by site name, address, or current location
- Filter community gardens and farms by produce (allowing community gardens like Encounter Farm to share excess produce, or local farms to advertise their available produce)
- User authentication
- Site information management features for authenticated site managers
- 2 calendars, one for farmers markets and one for workshops & events
- Additional features in development

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript
- Supabase (database & authentication)
- Netlify (deployment)

## Community Partners
- Encounter Farm
- Clark Park Community Garden
- Community Harvest

## Future Plans
- Add more site data for the map.
- Optimize the website UI for mobile view.
- Implement the Projects page to showcase projects for learning and collaboration (e.g., the irrigation project at Encounter Farm).
- Implement the Educate page to provide educational resources about sustainable farming, with ability for community contribution.
- Implement regional communication features, such as location-based messaging groups for growers, volunteers, and community members (e.g., helping people find and collaborate with others interested in starting a community garden).
- Develop a corresponding mobile app.
