# Food Web Website

This repository is the in-progress migration of the original Food Web website from vanilla JavaScript to React.js.

Food Web is an initiative to connect communities with their local food systems, increase access to locally grown food, inspire community engagement, and facilitate visibility and collaboration among growers, distributors, and volunteers. The website features an interactive map of community gardens, local farms, farmers markets, food banks, and compost collection sites, along with search and filtering, user authentication, and site information management features.

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript
- Supabase (database & authentication)
- Netlify (deployment)
